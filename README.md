    * INVITE: Invite a client to a channel
    ```sh
        INVITE user #channel
    ```

    * TOPIC: Change or view the channel topic
    ```sh
        #This command shoud print the TOPIC that has been set to channel
        TOPIC #channel

        #This command should set a new TOPIC to channel
        TOPIC #channel : NEW TOPIC
    ```

    * MODE: Change the channelâ€™s mode, this enable the channel's creator to set some config to channel like an admin.

        - i: Set/remove Invite-only channel
        ```sh
            #This MODE should restrict the users to only access the channel if they have a INVITE
            MODE #channel +i

            #This MODE deactivate the restriction to access the channel with an INVITE
            MODE #channel -i
        ```

        - t: Set/remove the restrictions of the TOPIC command to channel operators
        ```sh
            # This MODE restricts changing the channel TOPIC to only channel operators
            MODE #channel +t

            # This MODE removes the restriction, allowing any user to change the channel TOPIC
            MODE #channel -t
        ```

        - k: Set/remove the channel key (password)
        ```sh
            # This MODE restrict the users to only access the channel if they have known a password
            MODE #channel +k secretkey

            # This MODE removes the restriction, allowing any user to change access the channel
            MODE #channel -k
        ```

        - o: Give/take channel operator privilege
        ```sh
            # This MODE gives privileges to user to be operators
            MODE #channel +o user
