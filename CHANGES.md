  - `GetChannels()`
- Removed `Parser parser` member (moved to static methods)

### 5. **`srcs/server.cpp`**
- **Destructor enhancement**: Added proper cleanup for channels vector
- **`ClearClients()` method**: Enhanced to handle channel cleanup when clients disconnect
- **New channel management methods**:
  - `FindChannelByName()` - Locate channels by name
  - `CreateChannel()` - Create new channels with validation
